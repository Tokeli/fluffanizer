Organize your pictures! Meant to quickly parse through large amounts of images in a folder, and organize them into other folders, with GAMERCOOL keyboard control. Because buttons and hotkeys are for your grandma.

## Goals
* Add animated GIF support.
* Add "collections" where you can add extra filepaths and manually click to send a photo there, for instance if you encounter a comic in the middle of your folder.
* Mew.
